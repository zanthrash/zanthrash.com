## Intro

Can you dig all this

```js
// can you dig it
const foo = "bar";

console.log(foo);
```

I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F\*\*\* me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are!

Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! God knows they're squinters. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties.

Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate.

Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.
